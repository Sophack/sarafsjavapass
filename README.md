# Password Generator Starter Code

# This password generator has been programmed to create a secure, random password 

# The user is prompted to first pick a password length, see image: ("length.jpg") where the user must enter a numerical answer

# If a non numerical answer is chosen then it will prompt the user of that, see image: ("NaN.jpg")

# The user is then able to click on the "Generate Password" button to restart the prompt 

# If user has inputted a numerical figure, it moves onto the next prompts in the following order: 

#    "Would you like to include numbers in your password? 
#    "Would you like to include special characters? 
#    "Would you like to include uppercase letters? 
#    "Would you like to include lowercase letters? 

# Image: ("lowercase.jpg") shows what the prompt looks like, with the options "ok" and "cancel". Clicking "ok" will log true whereas 'cancel' will log false. 

# Image: ("generatedpass.jpg") shows the generated password when uppercase letters and numbers have been true & lowercase letters and special characters have been false. 

# Clicking on the generate password button will start everything again.
