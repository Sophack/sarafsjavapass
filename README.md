# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

 This password generator has been programmed to create a secure, random password 

 The user is prompted to first pick a password length, see image: ("length.jpg") where the user must enter a numerical answer

 If a non numerical answer is chosen then it will prompt the user of that, see image: ("NaN.jpg")

 The user is then able to click on the "Generate Password" button to restart the prompt 

## User Interface

 If user has inputted a numerical figure, it moves onto the next prompts in the following order: 

    "Would you like to include numbers in your password? 
    "Would you like to include special characters? 
    "Would you like to include uppercase letters? 
    "Would you like to include lowercase letters? 

# Images

    ("lowercase.jpg") shows what the prompt looks like, with the options "ok" and "cancel". Clicking "ok" will log true whereas 'cancel' will log false. 

    ("generatedpass.jpg") shows the generated password when uppercase letters and numbers have been true & lowercase letters and special characters have been false.
